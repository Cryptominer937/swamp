## **About Swamp**

**SWAMP** is a new innovative cryptocurrency that is building an ecosystem for its community. The Swamp community are passionate about cryptocurrency and truly believe blockchain technology is going to change the world. 

Swamp is an egalitarian Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency that uses YesPoWer 1.0 cpu only algorithm. Swamp will start off as a hybrid of PoW and masternodes, and will gradually move towards operating exclusively on masternodes to create a decentralised network which does not rely on any central body control. 

The Swamp team may seek to collaborate with other developers who share the same vision and can add value to the project.
