 
 Swamp Coin (SWAMP) Currency
=====================================

SWAMP is a egalitarian Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency building up a global community to be united against the inflationary nature of all world Fiat currency. As governments print an infinite amount of dollars, euros etc., SWAMP remains finite and predicable.  SWAMP is superior to fiat and traditional banks by:
- Masternodes to support consensus by the people (1000 SWAMP)
- CPU only mining to allow a wider variety of hardware to maximize decentralization
- Instant send and recieve funds globally without boarders or middle men
- Transparancy that comes with traditional blockchains
- Permissionless access to YOUR money... unlike banks
- Optional private sent features
